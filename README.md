# 🃏 Blackjack in Python

Welcome to my very first solo coding quest: a Python-powered Blackjack game!  
This repo is a **massive work in progress**, so expect bugs, chaos, and plenty of learning along the way.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build a playable Blackjack game in Python (console-based to start)
- Learn core programming concepts like loops, conditionals, and object-oriented design
- Eventually add features like betting, multiple players, and maybe even a GUI

## 🚧 Current Status

> ⚠️ No code yet! Just vibes and ambition.

This is the starting line. I'm sketching out ideas, researching game logic, and figuring out how to structure everything. If you're here early, you're witnessing the birth of something cool (or at least mildly entertaining).

## 🛠️ Planned Features

- [ ] Basic game loop (deal, hit, stand, bust, win)
- [ ] Card deck and shuffling logic
- [ ] Player vs dealer mechanics
- [ ] Score tracking
- [ ] Replay option
- [ ] Clean console UI

## 💡 Stretch Goals

- [ ] Betting system with virtual currency
- [ ] Multiple players
- [ ] GUI using Tkinter or Pygame
- [ ] Save/load game state
- [ ] Sound effects and animations (because why not?)

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

This project is my sandbox for:
- Python fundamentals
- Game logic and flow control
- Writing readable, maintainable code
- Git and GitHub basics

## 🙌 Contributions

This is a solo project for now, but if you have tips, feedback, or just want to cheer me on, feel free to open an issue or drop a comment. Encouragement is fuel!

Thanks for stopping by! Stay tuned for updates as I turn this blank repo into a fully playable Blackjack experience. 🎲
